CUDA is not a Programming Language or API, It is more than that, CUDA is a parallel computing platform which takes advantage of the use of the graphics processing unit GPU. We will work with NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA library.

This repository contains some examples in python of the use of CUDA to take advantage of the GPU of your computer and offers a comparison with CPU to validate the advantages it offers.
